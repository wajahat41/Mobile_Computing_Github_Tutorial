<h2>What is Github</h2>
<p>
    Github is a version control systemt that can be used to to create better software through keeping
    track of all the changes over time. It also provides a way to collaborate with other developers on Projects.<br>
    It is used by developers all over the world and is one of the largest software hosting website,
    with millions of repositries. <br><br> You can visit <a href"https://github.com/"> GitHub</a>
    This Tutorial will cover some basic ways in which github can be used.
</p>

<h2> Creating Account </h2>
<p> 
    You can visit <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a> website and create an account for free<br>
    <nbsp> </nbsp>Follow following steps to create an account </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Click on Sign up</li>
        <li>Provide basic details</li>
        <li>Verify Email</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And you have created a GitHub account.
</p>

<h2> Creating Repository On Github</h2>
<p> 
    A GitHub repository is a place that contains all of your files and folders for a specific project.
    Ideally, Each project should have it's seperate repository.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click on New</li>
    <li>Provide Repository Name</li>
    <li>Provide Repository desrciption</li>
    <li>Choose visibility (Public or Private)</li>
    <li>Click on Create</li>
</ol>

<p>
    And you have created your first repository.
</p>


<h2> Local Local Git Repository</h2>
<p> 
    A Local Git repository is a version control system that resides on the machine that you are working on.
</p>


<h3>
    Starting Local Repository
</h3>
<p>
    Starting the local repository is the first most step you will take. And it is fairly simple.

    You can use following command to start a local repository.<br>
    Make sure that you are in the directory where you want to start the repo.

    <h4>
        $ git init
    </h4>
</p>

<h3>
    Staging Area
</h3>
<p>
    Once you make changes to a file, first step is moving those files to a staging area.

    You can use following command to move files to a staging area.<br>
    |filename| is the name of file. You can use . to move all files to staging area.

    <h4>
        $git add | filename |
    </h4>
</p>

<h3>
    Status
</h3>
<p>
    Status shows if the files have been modified since last commit.
    If it if first time, status will show the files as unmarked.
    You can use following command to Check status of repository.<br>
    <h4>
        $git status
    </h4>
</p>

<h3>
    Committing
</h3>
<p>
    Commting is the stage in which you are actually saving the changes to repository.

    You can use following command to move files to commit changes<br>
    <h4>
        $git commit -m "This is where you put commit message"
    </h4>
</p> 
<br>

<h2> Remote Respositories</h2>
<p>
    In the previous step we created a local repository that is saved on your machine.
    Now, we are ready to connect this local respostory to a remote respostory, that will
    make our code availble on GitHub.<br>
</p>

<h3>
    Connecting to remote respository
</h3>
<p>
    Connecting to a remote repository means creating a link between our local respository
    and a repository on github. We will need the link of github respository for this step.

    You can use following command to connect to a remote repository.<br>
    | link | is the link of remote repository.
    <h4>
        $ git remote add origin | link | 
    </h4>
    <br>
</p> 


<h3>
    Git pull
</h3>
<p>
    Once we have connected the local and remote repositories we can now copy the code from our remote repository to our local repository and start working on the project.


    You can use following command to copy files from remote to local repo.<br>
    
    <h4>
        $ git pull 
    </h4>
    <br>
</p> 

<h3>
    Git push
</h3>
<p>
    After making changes to our local repository, we can commit these changes but this commit will take effect only in local repository. To save these changes to remote repository we will have to push the commits.

    You can use following command to save changes to remote repo.<br>
    <h4>
        $ git push
    </h4>
    <br>
</p>

<h2> Branching</h2>
<p>
    Branching is an important feature of Git and GitHub. Let's assume that you have a working
    application and you want to make some improvements in the application. But if you make changes
    in your repository there is a chance that you might break the application.<br>
    This is where Branching comes in. Branching let's you work on a different stream, and 
    after testing when you are sure, you can put connect two branches to form one branch.
</p>

<h3>
    Creating a new branch
</h3>
<p>
    You can use following command to save changes to create a new branch in your repo.<br>
    where | branchname | is the name that you want to give to this branch.
    <h4>
        $ git branch | branchname|
    </h4>
    <br>
</p> 

<h3>
     Seeing all branches
</h3>
<p>
    You can use following command to See all the branches that exist.<br>
    
    <h4>
        $ git branch
    </h4>
    <br>
</p> 
<h3>
    Switching between branches
</h3>
<p>
    You can use following command to move to a different branch.<br>
    where | branchname | is the name that you want to move to.
    <h4>
        $ git checkout | branchname|
    </h4>
    <br>
</p> 

<h3>
    Merging two branches
</h3>
<p>
    You can use following command to merge two branches.<br>
    First switch to the branch to which you want to merge.
    where | branchname | is the name that you want to merge into this branch.
    <h4>
        $ git merge | branchname |
    </h4>
    <br>
</p>
